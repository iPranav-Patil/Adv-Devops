1. What is DevOps?
   - DevOps is a cultural and technical approach that emphasizes collaboration and communication between software development and IT operations teams. It aims to automate and streamline the software delivery process.

2. What are the basic features of DevOps?
   - Automation, collaboration, continuous integration, continuous delivery, and monitoring are key features of DevOps.

3. DevOps architecture:
   - DevOps doesn't have a specific architecture, but it typically involves the integration of development and operations tools through various stages of the software development lifecycle.

4. DevOps lifecycle:
   - The DevOps lifecycle involves planning, coding, building, testing, releasing, deploying, monitoring, and feedback.

5. What's Jenkins, advantages, and disadvantages?
   - Jenkins is an open-source automation server used for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD). Advantages include automation, extensibility, and a large plugin ecosystem. Disadvantages may include a learning curve and complex setup.

6. Different tools used in DevOps:
   - Tools like Git, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, Puppet, Ansible, and many others are commonly used in DevOps.

7. What's Docker?
   - Docker is a containerization platform that allows you to package applications and their dependencies into containers for consistent and portable deployment.

8. Different Git commands:
   - Basic Git commands include git clone, git commit, git push, git pull, and git branch for version control.

9. Explain Puppet and its usage in DevOps:
   - Puppet is a configuration management tool. It automates the provisioning and management of infrastructure and application configurations in DevOps.

10. Basics of NAGIOS, where it can be used, and limitations:
    - Nagios is a monitoring tool used to track the health and performance of IT infrastructure. It can be used for network, server, and service monitoring. Limitations include complexity in large environments.

11. Basic difference between DevOps and AdvDevOps:
    - Advanced DevOps typically extends DevOps with more advanced tools and practices, emphasizing scalability, security, and compliance.

12. Features of AWS:
    - AWS (Amazon Web Services) offers cloud computing services, including storage, computing, databases, machine learning, and more.

13. Use of Kubernetes:
    - Kubernetes is used for container orchestration, managing, and scaling containerized applications.

14. What is Kubernetes?
    - Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

15. Features of SonarQube:
    - SonarQube is a code quality and security analysis tool that provides features like code quality analysis, security scanning, and code coverage.

16. Comparison of Kubernetes with Docker:
    - Docker is a containerization platform, while Kubernetes is an orchestration platform for managing containerized applications.

17. Role of Lambda function in AWS:
    - Lambda functions are serverless computing services in AWS, used to execute code in response to various triggers or events, often used for building serverless applications.
